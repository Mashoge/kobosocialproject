I want you to generate a full React + TypeScript project request flow using Firebase. Here are the details:

1. **Firebase Setup**
   - I already have `firebase.ts` with Firestore and Storage configured and exported as `db` and `storage`.
   - I already have `projectRequestService.ts` with a `createProjectRequest` function that uploads files and stores project requests in Firestore.

2. **Client Side**
   - Update the existing Client Project Request Form so that submitting it calls `createProjectRequest` and stores the form data + uploaded files in Firestore.
   - Map the form fields correctly:
     - `title` → `projectTitle`
     - `description` → `projectDescription`
     - `name` → `clientName`
     - `email` → `email`
     - `country`, `address`, `contactNumber` → optional fields in Firestore
   - Implement file upload for ZIP, PDF, PNG, JPEG, XLS.
   - Display toast notifications on success/failure.
   - Reset the form and redirect to `/client-dashboard` on success.

3. **Admin Side**
   - Replace the mock `initialRequests` data with real Firestore data.
   - Fetch all project requests from Firestore when the page loads.
   - Display the list of pending requests.
   - When a request is selected, show details including project description, client info, and attached files.
   - Allow admin to approve/reject requests:
     - Updating the request status in Firestore via `updateProjectRequestStatus`.
     - Automatically remove the request from the pending list after action.
   - Keep the existing layout, styling, and buttons.

4. **Navigation**
   - Client and Admin pages should have working Home buttons that redirect appropriately.
   - Ensure React Router (or Wouter) routing is consistent.

5. **Figma Reference**
   - Base the UI on this Figma link: https://www.figma.com/design/va0567KHpQmUzANFCS2dux/Untitled--Copy-?node-id=0-1&t=MeykXwDHCOldl5nc-1

6. **Output**
   - Provide full TypeScript code for:
     - `ClientRequestFormPage.tsx`
     - `ProjectRequestsPage.tsx` (Admin)
   - Include all necessary imports and hooks.
   - Ensure the code compiles in a standard Replit React/TypeScript project.
   - No mock data; all data should come from Firestore.

7. **Extra**
   - Include proper error handling.
   - Include comments in code to explain Firestore interactions.
